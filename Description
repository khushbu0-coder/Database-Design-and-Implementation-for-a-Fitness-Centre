Brief Description About Relational Model:
Firstly, the table is in 0NF form , as it contains the multivalued attributes such as Amenities, Reviews and References.

To convert it into 1 NF , we have created separate linking tables for multivalued attributes .
As ,Amenities table  has no PK so AmenitiesGymID will become PK in this table that points toward GymID in base table .Similarly ,  Review table has no PK so ReviewCoachID will become PK in this table that points toward CoachID in base table .
Besides this , References table has its own PK (Client ID) so Coach ID will become FK in this table and it will also points towards the CoachID of base table.
To convert it into 2NF , we will remove partial dependencies , so new tables will be created having full dependencies which are Location table , Gym table , Classes table , Coaches Table, Certificates table , Courses Table.
Moreover , Certificates is an associative entity as it has one to many relationship towards  both Coaches and Courses . 
To be in 3NF , the table should be free of transitive dependencies , as this table has no transitive dependencies so it is already in 3NF form .
